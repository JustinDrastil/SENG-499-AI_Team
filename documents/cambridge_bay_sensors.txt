Cambridge Bay is one of Ocean Networks Canada's primary Arctic observatory locations. It hosts a variety of oceanographic sensors to monitor environmental changes in real time.

Some of the key sensors deployed in Cambridge Bay include:

1. CTDs (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth sensors) to measure water properties.
2. ADCPs (Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers) to measure water current velocities.
3. Cameras for undersea video monitoring of marine life and ice conditions.
4. Hydrophones to capture underwater acoustic data.
5. Oxygen and pH sensors to monitor chemical properties of the ocean.

These instruments help scientists understand how climate change affects the Arctic ecosystem and contribute valuable data for long-term monitoring.
