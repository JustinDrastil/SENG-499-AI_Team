Researchers in the Computer Science Department at the University of Victoria, including Prof. Yvonne Coady and her colleagues including Dr. Nico Preston, are collaborating with scientists at ONC on the development of oceanographic models of earthquakes and tsunamis. These models feed into virtual reality (VR) simulations and demonstrate the effect that different kinds of tsunamis could have on communities and infrastructure. A notable case in point is Port Alberni, BC, which is located at the end of a long narrow inlet that magnifies the effect of tsunamis, and which has been severely damaged in previous tsunamis.

The research from this effort can be used for Emergency Preparedness and Emergency Management, and can warn the public in the event of emergencies as well as assist Emergency Management personnel in responding to emergencies, by providing capabilities such as a remote digital Emergency Operations Center (EOC).

The Oceans 3.0 API is being used to obtain higher-quality data for more reliable simulations.
