**Data Delivery Services**
--------------------------

### Archive Files

Most filetypes for a deviceCategory that are found via Oceans3.0 Data Search portal (<https://data.oceannetworks.ca/DataSearch>) are already archive and can be retrieved with the OpenAPI ArchiveFile services ([Oceans 3.0 API Home#archivefiles](/spaces/O2A/pages/48696392/Oceans+3.0+API+Home#Oceans3.0APIHome-archivefiles))

**NOTE**: Especially **hydrophone** data can be downloaded this way with the file extensions "flac" or "mp3". 

The OpenAPI page provided two method options:

1. getListByLocation: <https://data.oceannetworks.ca/OpenAPI#get-/archivefile/location>
2. getListByDevice: <https://data.oceannetworks.ca/OpenAPI#get-/archivefile/device>

Fill out the fields as per example and the return will be a JSON with the field "files":

![](/download/attachments/124912264/Screenshot%202025-06-03%20at%2010.32.25%E2%80%AFAM.png?version=1&modificationDate=1748971972000&api=v2)

 The files can be downloaded in either the next step: <https://data.oceannetworks.ca/OpenAPI#get-/archivefile/download> by entering the filenames individually or programmatically with your language of choice.

### Data Product Delivery Services

Request data product (LF - logfile; extension: txt) from CTD at NCBC

* [https://data.oceannetworks.ca/OpenAPI#get-/dataProductDelivery-request](https://data.oceannetworks.ca/OpenAPI)

* Once all required parameters are filled in (\* indicated) data product options can be filtered (see arrow)
* The return field indicates the approx. time for the request to run and the file size to be expected from this data request
* The dpRequestId is utilized in the next step

Run data product request(LF - logfile; extension: txt) from CTD at NCBC

* <https://data.oceannetworks.ca/OpenAPI#get-/dataProductDelivery-run>
* The page prefills the dpRequestId from your previous step.
* You can re-run any requests multiple times by filling in the appropriate dpRequestId.
* Notes:

  + the dpRunId is utilized in next step
  + the status indicates the process state: queued, completed (hit **Try** to update status)
  + fileCount: indicates how many files to be downloaded

Download data product

* The page prefills the dpRunId from your previous step.
* The index indicates the file number to download: 1 to the number of result files. If index is string **meta**, metadata file will be downloaded.
* The data product will be automatically downloaded from your browser. It can take a while for the download to complete – be patient.
