**Description**
---------------

The API **deviceCategories** service returns all device categories defined in Oceans 3.0 that meet a filter criteria.

A Device Category represents an instrument type classification such as CTD (Conductivity, Temperature & Depth Instrument) or BPR (Bottom Pressure Recorder). Devices from a category can record data for one or more properties (variables).

The primary purpose of this service, is to find device categories that have the data you want to access; the service provides the deviceCategoryCode you can use when requesting a data product via the [dataProductDelivery](/spaces/O2A/pages/48696520/dataProductDelivery+Service)web service.

Several current metres are installed on the Regional Circulation Moorings (RCM) at Endeavour. The instruments are spaced at various depths on the RCM moorings, and are used to study currents within the axial rift valley of Endeavour Ridge.

#### API Proxy

The <https://data.oceannetworks.ca>/**apiproxy**/deviceCategories URL link in the above examples can be used in a browser for sharing or testing purposes; however, it can not be accessed from code. Calls to the apiproxy server are redirected to a login screen to capture your user id. Accessing the apiproxy URL from code will return html in the payload, which may cause errors or unexpected behaviour. In order to use the deviceCategories endpoint from code, you must use the <https://data.oceannetworks.ca/>**api**/deviceCateogies url along with a valid token.
