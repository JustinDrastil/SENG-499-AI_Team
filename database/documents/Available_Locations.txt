The following is a list of all of the locations codes relating to Cambridge Bay.

The **locationCode** values can be used as a filter on the [devices](/spaces/O2A/pages/48696422/devices+Discovery+Service), [deviceCategories](/spaces/O2A/pages/48696424/deviceCategories+Discovery+Service), [properties](/spaces/O2A/pages/48696426/properties+Discovery+Service), [dataProducts](/spaces/O2A/pages/48696428/dataProducts+Discovery+Service) and [dataProductDelivery](/spaces/O2A/pages/48696520/dataProductDelivery+Service) services. Filters on the **locationCode**, **locationName** and **description** columns can be used to reduce the results returned from the [locations](/spaces/O2A/pages/49447546/locations+Discovery+Service) service. The **dataSearchURL** column provides a link to the location in the Data Search, for interactive download of data. The **hasDeviceData** indicates that data products can be requested using a device category code for the location and the **hasPropertyData** indicates that data products can be requested using a property code for the location.
