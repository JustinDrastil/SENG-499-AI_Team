Overview
========

User defined tasks are custom tasks created by uploading user code into DMAS and executing the code in a minimal system. The system can access ONC data and an FTP folder to store results. This allows users to create their own algorithms to create custom data products that they can then use for other purposes. A user may choose to share their code with all other users without the source code being visible to those users.

Usage
=====

Sharing your code with others
-----------------------------

You may choose to share your code with other users by checking the 'Shareable' checkbox while filling out the form on the Task Details tab. Users will be able to run your application but will not have access to the source code or the ability to make changes to your application.

Running your application
------------------------

### How to run -- all languages (C/C++, Matlab, Python, R)

1. Create an app that uses ONC's API
2. Test that it will work with a small subset of data on your own machine
3. Go to [data.oceannetworks.ca](http://data.oceannetworks.ca/) and click on the More → Task Management item in the menu bar
4. Click on the Task Detail tab
   1. Fill in the Name and Description of your task
   2. Upload the source files of your app by clicking on the Choose Files button (Note: You can ctrl click to select more than one at a time)
   3. In Base Images choose the language in which you wrote your app
   4. Add the name of your main file to the Command field and any arguments you need (ex: main.py --filter 1000)
      1. If you are using the Matlab base image include the name of your main file in the 'Command' field without the extension (ex: main vs main.m)
      2. If you are using C/C++ use the name of the executable that your Makefile produces
   5. (**Optional**) Check 'Shareable' to share your application
   6. Click Save
5. Once the sandbox is done building your image:
   1. If your image does not build correctly follow the error message instructions and reupload your code
   2. If the image built correctly click Run Now to run your application
6. Switch to the Task Monitor tab and select the name of your task to watch its progress
   1. If you go to your FTP directory you can also get the STDOUT and STDERR logs of your application in the data.tar file
   2. The FTP directory is available by clicking on the More → FTP Directory item in the menu bar
7. Once finished go to your FTP directory and download the results from data.tar

### Specific information for Python

Our python installation comes with a few libraries for science applications.

#### Library List

* numpy
* onc (See our API docs for reference)
* wavio
* scipy
* matplotlib (UI functions are disabled. You must save plots to a file and can not display them.)

### Specific information for C/C++

You must include:

1. a Makefile
   1. The makefile should specify the source compilation and any linking needed. If you have external libraries, the makefile can install them by calling the libraries' make/configuration commands.
2. the C/C++ source code
3. any external libraries as single files (directories have to be archived as .zip or .tar.gz files)

An example makefile. ![](https://internal.oceannetworks.ca/download/attachments/20388082/image2018-6-7_16-19-52.png?version=1&modificationDate=1528413544000&api=v2)
