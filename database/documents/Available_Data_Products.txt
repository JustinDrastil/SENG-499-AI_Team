All data products
-----------------

The following dynamic list of all of the data products, are being pulled from the [dataProducts](/spaces/O2A/pages/48696428/dataProducts+Discovery+Service) web service using the URL [http://data.oceannetworks.ca/api/dataProducts?method=get&token=[YOUR\_TOKEN\_HERE]](http://dmas.uvic.ca/apiproxy/dataProducts?method=get)

The **dataProductCode** values can be used as a filter on the [locations](/spaces/O2A/pages/49447546/locations+Discovery+Service) and [devices](/spaces/O2A/pages/48696422/devices+Discovery+Service) services and along with **extension** values on the [dataProductDelivery](/spaces/O2A/pages/48696520/dataProductDelivery+Service) service. Filters on the **dataProductCode**, **dataProductName and****extension**columns can be used to reduce the results returned from the [dataProducts](/spaces/O2A/pages/48696428/dataProducts+Discovery+Service) service. The **helpDocument** column provides a link to the Help documentation for the specific Data Product. All of the information about the data product options and their usage, needed to successfully request a data product, can be found in the documentation.
